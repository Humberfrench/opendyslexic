﻿#ReadMeThis is an effort to recreate Open-Dyslexic with the SIL-OFL typeface.##Why?The Bitstream license was too restrictive, and my attempts at clarifying what was allowed (pretty much anything) just confused everything even  more. I should have also done it from the start. ##SubmissionsOpen-Dyslexic submissions were messy because they mostly came in compiled typeface files, creating a lot of work in comparing files, properly pulling them from the compiled typeface and moving them over to the app native source being used.As such, submissions are accepted as long as:* it's provided as a pull request against  the typeface source* it's submitted as an SVG document##Allowed uses:_see OFL-FAQ.txt_ ## Re-hostingKISS. If you put it on a CDN to share, let me know, and I can include links.## Sharing ProductsI'll work on a submission process for this. E-mail wasn't the best place to receive these.##Attribution_the OFL-FAQ.txt document is fantastic at frequently asked questions, and it contains information about this also. :)_If you _need_  my *preferred* attribution method:  * Include name, typeface name and URL so others know where to find it..
